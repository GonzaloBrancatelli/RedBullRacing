            <h2>Max Verstappen</h2>
            <h3>Formula 1 World Champion Max Verstappen was born to be fast and comes from a racing heritage.</h3>
            <img class="drivers-img" src="https://www.f1latam.com/img/prin/mv55.jpg" alt="Max Verstappen con el puño en alto y sonriente">
            <p>The son of former F1 driver Jos Verstappen and Belgian kart champion Sophie Kumpen, Max took the karting
                world by storm, winning national, international and world titles. Then, having reached the required age
                he moved into single-seaters for the 2014 season, contesting the FIA European Formula 3 Championship.
                In 2020 he finished third in the Drivers’ Championship, taking victories at the 70th Anniversary Grand
                Prix at Silverstone and the season finale in Abu Dhabi. The victories were supported by remarkable
                consistency, as he finished on the podium 11 times from the 12 races in which he saw the chequered flag.

                
                A third victory of the campaign arrived at the French Grand Prix before delivering a brace of crushing
                wins at the team’s home circuit, the Red Bull Ring, home of the Styrian and Austrian Grands Prix.
                The Team’s rivals managed to find a significant performance boost, however, and over the following three
                rounds, the Dutchman’s chief rival, Lewis Hamilton, roared back into contention. In the end, after 21
                rounds and almost 23,000 laps raced, the fight went down to the wire at the season-ending Abu Dhabi
                Grand Prix with Max level on points with Hamilton.
                The battle was epic, highly charged, and hard fought, but following a late safety car period Max closed
                in and overtook Hamilton on the last lap of the race to take the race lead, victory and the 2021 Formula
                1 Drivers’ World Championship title.</p>

            <h2>Checo Perez</h2>
            <h3>Drive, passion and determination is what keeps Sergio Pérez hunting wins in Formula One.</h3>
            <img class="drivers-img" src="https://www.infobae.com/new-resizer/pLQh2nbAJY7-eQjBxjtlh9X9n-U=/768x512/filters:format(webp):quality(85)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/infobae/UZ7XA6ZUHLMAMMNZXI3ZRDE5DE.jpg"
                alt="Checo Perez sonriente">
            <p>
                Sergio ‘Checo’ Perez began his career aged six. His ascent up the karting ranks was swift and at one
                point required a special dispensation to allow him to compete in more powerful machinery outside his age
                group.

                Following his 2020 successes, the Mexican driver was drafted in to race alongside Max Verstappen and in
                his first year with the team proved his value on numerous occasions, taking one win and five podiums on
                his way to fourth place in the overall driver standings.

                It wasn’t an easy start to the campaign for the recruit, however, as he got to grips with the RB16B.
                Although despite the adjustment period, Checo posted four top-five finishes from the opening five races.

                The Mexican’s season came alive at the Azerbaijan Grand Prix, where Checo once again made the most of
                race dramas to win a tense standing re-start battle with Lewis Hamilton and take a memorable first
                victory with Red Bull Racing.

                Sergio added another podium finish with third place at the next race, in France, but thereafter he
                consistently finished in the top five from Round 8 in Styria to Round 15 in Italy.

                After Italy, something clicked and Checo found the sweet spot he had been searching for. A third podium
                of the year, in Turkey, was followed by third place finishes in the US and, jubilantly, on home soil in
                Mexico.               

                A true team player, devastatingly quick in his own right and strategically brilliant racer, Checo’s
                second season with the Team promises more epic moments to remember.

                          <p>Christian’s path to the top rung of the Formula One management ladder began behind the wheel, as a
                            talented young racer. After rising through the ranks to Formula 3000 in the late 1990s, Christian
                            eventually hung up his racing overalls and moved to a management role. At the age of 25 he founded
                            the Arden International Race Team, and quickly built the squad into a formidable winning machine.
                            Three consecutive International Formula 3000 Team championships as well as Drivers’ titles in 2003
                            and 2004 brought the young Team owner to the attention of Red Bull co-founder Dietrich Mateschitz
                            and when the company decided to field its own F1 entry in 2005, it turned to Christian to run the
                            operation.
                            To date, the Team has accumulated 64 victories and 119 other podium finishes. It has 63 pole
                            positions and 68 fastest laps. And while Christian is still one of the youngest Team Principals in
                            the F1 paddock, entering his 18th season at the helm of Oracle Red Bull Racing Honda, he is also its
                            most experienced.</p>

                          <p>Paul is one of the most experienced and knowledgeable engineers working in the paddock. His Formula
                            One journey began soon after he had gained his Masters’ degree in Mechanical Engineering when he
                            began working at McLaren in 1990. Working on the cars driven by the legendary Ayrton Senna and
                            teammate Gerhard Berger had a big impact and Paul would spend the rest of the decade at the Woking
                            team, eventually rising to the position of data engineer, working alongside two people who would
                            both reappear later in his career: driver David Coulthard and Adrian Newey.
                            As part of Oracle Red Bull Racing’s senior technical management, Paul’s is not supposed to be a
                            ‘hands-on’ role but more often than not he is to be found in the garage or the race bays, either
                            deep in conversation with the Team’s mechanics and trackside engineers, or staring intently at a
                            detailed element of the car, willing the RB16B to give up its secrets.</p>

                          <p>After studying aeronautics at Southampton University and early stints with the Fittipaldi and March
                            F1 Teams, Newey first tasted success across the Atlantic. His March sports car design won IMSA’s GTP
                            class in 1983 and 1984, and his IndyCar project, the March 85C, won the CART Championship and the
                            Indy 500. The follow-up 86C won the CART title in 1986 and the Indy 500 in both ‘86 and ‘87 but F1
                            was calling, and after brief tenures with FORCE and March, Newey was, by 1990, at Williams.
                            While our designs are a huge collective effort in the modern era, every Oracle Red Bull Racing car
                            still contains Adrian’s distinctive philosophies and insight. With another huge aerodynamic shakeup
                            looming large on the horizon, those skills have never been more highly prized.</p>
